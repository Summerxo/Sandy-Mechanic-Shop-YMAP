Hey! Another Map made by =(eGO)= Summer

Alrighty,

Installating XML: drop the XML file in your spooner folder = GTAV > menyooStuff> Spooner
Note: This will take just a moment to load the file.


For installing YMAP : 
Drop into a stream folder. If you are running the bobIPL resource: DLC_GunRunning > Bunkers (remove the Exterior IPLs, if you don't it will conflict with back parking lot) If you don't use bobIPL or any IPLs that would load heist stuff, then you will be fine!



Location: > x 2082 3381 48
